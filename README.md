GDELTCountryMediaComparisons.ipynb
  Open this in google colab. It should be able to run by itself after that.
  This project takes GDELT data and attemtps to find a clustering relationship between different countries based on their media's views towards other countries.
  Admittedly, there is little value to this project, but it was fun I guess.
